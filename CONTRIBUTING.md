We are open to have this project grow and as such welcome with open arms everyone who wants to contribute

## contribution process
1. Fork the repo
2. If you are adding a new framework, create a file in the files/ folder and add references to `files/ask.rb` and `executables/build.rb`
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

## contribution ideas
While we are open to any contributions, here are some ideas to get you started:
- more frameworks
- better landing pages: both in terms of better design and showcasing more the strengths of each framework
- tests: automate checking that the app was created successfully with all the frameworks, to development errors
- production vs development version: having a version just for localhost projects or pseudo-static sites, and another for production projects with users (adding gems like devise and similar)
