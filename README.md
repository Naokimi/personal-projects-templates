# personal-projects-templates
A Rails 6 template to quickly generate apps for personal use. The main goal is allow for easy experimentation with different UX/UI frameworks - when running the template just choose a framework from the options available.

Inspired heavily by [Le Wagon's Rails Templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). Would not exist without them.

Special thanks also to [Rails Kickoff â€“ Tailwind](https://github.com/justalever/kickoff_tailwind) and [Jumpstart Rails Template](https://github.com/excid3/jumpstart).

### Usage

run `rails new APP-NAME -d=postgresql -T -m personal-projects-templates/template.rb`
after rails vanilla installs, pick one of the framework options and press Enter

## Contents

Creating an app using this template gives you an option amongs several UX/UI frameworks, a set of gems to help with you development, and a landing page with a navbar, footer (sticky at bottom with flexbox), banner, and a link to the framework's documentation.
