# rails-multiUIs-template
**DISCLAIMER**
Repo has been archived due to being unable to lack of compatibility with the newest UI framework versions, being unable to keep up with the changes. I'm planning to return to this project down the line.

A Rails 6 template to quickly generate apps for personal use. The main goal is allow for easy experimentation with different UX/UI frameworks - when running the template just choose a framework from the options available.

Inspired heavily by [Le Wagon's Rails Templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates). Would not exist without them.

Special thanks also to [Rails Kickoff â€“ Tailwind](https://github.com/justalever/kickoff_tailwind) and [Jumpstart Rails Template](https://github.com/excid3/jumpstart).

### Usage

run `rails new APP-NAME -d=postgresql -T -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naokimi/rails-multiUIs-template/master/template.rb`

after rails vanilla installs, pick one of the framework options and press Enter

## Contents

Creating an app using this template gives you an option amongs several UX/UI frameworks, a set of gems to help with you development, and a landing page with a navbar, footer (sticky at bottom with flexbox), banner, and a link to the framework's documentation.
